#Task 3 â€“ Tic Tac Toe Web App

As part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology, I was assigned Task 3: Building a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The aim of this task was to design and implement an interactive and visually appealing game that demonstrates my ability to:

Create responsive user interfaces

Handle user events & DOM manipulation

Implement simple AI logic for Player vs Computer mode

Maintain state and show a scoreboard

Use animations and styling to enhance UX

This task helped me gain practical experience in front-end web development and strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
